# AWS Dark Docs

#### Description
Script to be used with [Greaseonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox users) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome users) to read AWS Documentation in **Dark Mode**. Follow [this](https://github.com/moderntribe/tampermonkey-scripts) instructions on *how to install*.  

#### Notes
- For pure CSS manipulation, the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) extension is a better choice than Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey. Pure `.css` file is also available for this purpose.  
- Currently not implemented for `cli` and `api-reference` documentation.
